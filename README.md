# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project creates a model to learn and predict fraudulent transactions from  a creditcard csv file.
There are three methods: random oversampling, random undersampling and the combination of these two methods.
The frauds will be shown by a graph with a different color. The model is expected to predict the frauds from the split data with fairly high accuracy

The csv file can be downloaded here: https://datahub.io/machine-learning/creditcard
